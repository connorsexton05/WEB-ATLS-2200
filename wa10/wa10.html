          For this weeks WA assignment, we were tasked with changing the ICA10 API assignment to reflect our own styling
          and to change the API we are grabbing data from. Originally, it was a quote generator, but I changed it to be a
          joke generator. A "Joke-inator". For my extension, I added two buttons: a save to favorites and a view favorites button.
          This saves the joke and punchline via localStorage and puts them into a collapsible section for the user to view again when they please.

          For my critique project, I would see myself using Spotify's public API. This would give me the ability 
          to pull real data on artists, playlists, and track popularity. I would use this to redesigned the current trash recommendation 
          system that recommends more independent and diverse artists. The API would provide the data to reshape what users see on their Spotify feed.
