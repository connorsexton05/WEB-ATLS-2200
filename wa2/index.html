                ><h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently a student at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying Creative Technology and Design Engineering in the ATLAS Institute at CU. I have a passion for music, physical computing, audio engineering, and the process of developing practical solutions, both physical and digital. I thrive in team environments, adapt quickly, and am eager to expand and develop my skill set. Outside of school I play in a band called Sketchwork, and am an avid outdoorsman, enjoying backpacking, skiing, and climbing.</p>
