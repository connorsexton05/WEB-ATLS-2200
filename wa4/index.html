            <p>Hey There! I am a third-year student studying Creative Technology and Design Engineering at the ATLAS Institute at CU Boulder. I have a passion for music, physical computing, audio engineering, and the process of developing practical solutions, both physical and digital. I excel in collaborative team environments, adapt quickly, and am constantly eager to expand and develop my skill set.</p>

        <h3>Automated Guitar Pick Dispenser</h3>
        <img src="Photos/pickdisp.jpeg" alt="pick dispenser" height="350" width="325">
        <p>An Arduino powered guitar pick dispenser designed and constructed by me in OnShape. Utilizes stepper motors and ultrasonic distance sensors to operate similarly to a soap dispenser. Solves my pet peeve of dropping guitar picks while playing!</p>
